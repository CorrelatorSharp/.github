# Notice about end of life

There is now broad support for the OpenTelemtry standard in .NET and as such the need for things like CorrelatorSharp is greatly diminished.

We are advising everyone move towards the open standard and has a good time. This set of packages is going into EoL. 

It's been great, thanks for your support. I hope that the ideas and code contained in this set of repos has helped you debug issues and give your users a better experience.
